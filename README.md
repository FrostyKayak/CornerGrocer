# CornerGrocer
Reflection
1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving

The Corner Grocer Project was created to analyze grocery store transaction data and show how often each item was purchased. The program reads from a text file, counts item frequencies, saves that data to a backup file called frequency.dat, and gives the user a simple menu with different options. The goal was to help the store make better decisions about how to organize inventory and display popular items more effectively.

2. What did you do particularly well?

I did a good job keeping the code organized and easy to follow. I used a class structure to separate tasks, and the map made it simple to count how often each item appeared. The menu system works smoothly, and the histogram gives a quick visual of which items are most popular. Overall, I think I balanced structure and simplicity well.

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I could improve the program by adding more input checks. For example, I could make it handle different capital letters so that “Apple” and “apple” are treated as the same item. It would also help to allow users to choose which file they want to load instead of using the same one every time. These updates would make the program more flexible, accurate, and user friendly.

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging part was getting the menu loop and file handling to work correctly. Sometimes the program did not respond the way I expected when I tested certain options. I solved this by testing one feature at a time and using temporary print statements to see what was happening in the program. I also reviewed C plus plus documentation and online examples, which helped me understand file streams and map functions better.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

This project strengthened my understanding of file reading and writing, maps, loops, and class structure. These are important concepts that apply to almost any software project. I also gained more practice with building command line programs that interact with users, which is a helpful foundation for future courses and projects.

6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I focused on keeping the code simple and easy to read. Each function has one clear purpose, and I used descriptive names and comments to make the logic clear. The output is neatly formatted with consistent spacing and alignment. Because of this structure, new features can be added later without changing large parts of the program.
